# Suduko-Solver-Using-OpenCV-Python

Hello Everyone ! I have made a Sudoku Solver Using OpenCV Python.  

When we add image of a sudoku puzzle the program will apply several and suitable image cropping algorithms on it & the final output will be displayed on the image of puzzle provided itself. 
zip file contains all the images and model required to program work, hence first install zip file and extract it. After Extraction you will see 'Resources' folder, this folder have model and images of sudoku puzzles.
